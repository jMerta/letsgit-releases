# LetsGit

**Fast Git UI for massive repos.**

LetsGit is a desktop Git client built for repositories that bring other tools to their knees. Virtualized UI, CLI-first backend (spawns your system `git`), and chunked diffs that stay responsive even in repos with decades of history.

This repository hosts release artifacts and is the place to **report bugs**, **request features**, and **share feedback**.
